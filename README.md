### Summary

The Rock Paper Scissors game application is a single page application (SPA).<br>

##### The rules of the game:

Each player has to do with his hand one of the following three shapes, a punch that is a rock, an open hand that is paper and a hand with two (V) shaped fingers that are scissors.<br><br>

The winner is the one who made paper with the hand and the opposing player made a rock with the hand, or the player made scissors with the hand and the opposing player made a paper with the hand and finally if the player made a rock with the hand and the opposing player made scissors with the hand.<br><br>

In the game here you can accumulate points and whoever reaches 5 points is the winner.
Then a model message pops up that says who is the winner.<br><br>
